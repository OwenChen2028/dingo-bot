# Getting Started with DingoBot üêæ

DingoBot, short for **Discord Lingo Bot**, is a simple tool for managing and sharing definitions in your Discord server. Whether you're part of a gaming guild, a study group, or just a community with inside jokes, DingoBot makes it easy to keep track of your server‚Äôs custom terms.

## How to Use DingoBot

Here‚Äôs what you can do with DingoBot:

- `/init` - Initializes a new table for the current server.
- `/create <term> <definition>` - Adds a term and its definition to the current server\'s table.
- `/read <term>` - Finds a term in the current server\'s table and displays its information.
- `/readall` - Displays all rows in the current server\'s table.
- `/update <term> <definition>` - Updates the definition of a term in the current server\'s table.
- `/delete <term>` - Deletes a term from the current server\'s table.
- `/deleteall` - Deletes all rows from the current server\'s table.
- `/lookup <term> <message>` - Searches for the specified term within the current server‚Äôs table and provides an explanation of it in the context of the given message. Unlike the read command, the specified term does not have to match the term in the database exactly. In the current implementation, this is the only command available to non-admin users.

### Examples
- Define gaming terms like "gg" or "strat" for your guild.
- Create a glossary of server memes or inside jokes.

# DingoBot Deployment Guide

Here‚Äôs how to get DingoBot up and running using Node.js.

## Prerequisites

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
